# Introduction - what is Version Control?

Please watch this video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r50BKIFGCI0>

We'll start by giving a brief introduction to *Version Control*, which is a system you might have actually used before. Version Control is a system that allows a set files to be changed by multiple users and records a history of those changes.

Have you ever used Google Drive or Dropbox before? You can think of those as types of Version Control. Multiple users can edit documents and files simultaneously and Google Drive will keep track of who edited what documents and at what time.

## What is Git?

Git is a type of Version Control, but dedicated to coding. Git allows multiple users to simultaneously edit files and records those changes in a history log. Each of these history logs is a "backup version in the past", which you can revert back to whenever you'd like.

This is useful if you ever get into a situation where you are creating a feature but accidentally break other functionalities. With version control, you can easily revert back to an older version when the other functionalities are not broken!

## What is Github?

Github is a company that provides a website portal to promote "social coding". By itself, Git is just a set of commands you can input in your computer that will manage files. With Github, you can create projects and share them with other coders. Or, you can create teams and invite friends to collaborate with on your projects. In addition, Github also provides many tools to help coders improve the quality of their code and working environments. There are several other companies that provide similar services, such as Bitbucket, GitLab, etc. Github is just the most popular website to use, especially for personal or smaller coding projects.
