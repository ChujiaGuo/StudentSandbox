## Verify Git Installed

Open up Terminal / Command Prompt and input the following command (from any directory):

```unix
git --version
```

This will display the version number of git installed on your computer. If this command does not work, you may have to close Terminal / Command Prompt and try this command again. If it still doesn't work, you may have to retry the install process.

## Configure Git

Once you've confirmed that Git has installed correctly. Configure your git using the following two commands. Make sure the email you use here matches the email you used to sign up for Github in an earlier step.

```unix
git config --global user.name "Emma Paris"
git config --global user.email "eparis@atlassian.com"
```
