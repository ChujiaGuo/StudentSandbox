# Great work finishing the Git guide!

At this point, you should've pinged me that your Pull Request is ready. If I approve your Pull Request, you can finally click on the **Merge Pull Request** button to finish and merge your changes to the `master` branch. WooT!

However, if I make a comment and request additional changes from you (i.e. you had a typo or something), please refer to the last chapter of this guide and go through the same steps:

- Make sure you are on the correct local branch (same name as the remote branch in your Pull Request)
  - Use `git branch` to double check which branch you are on (should be highlighted as green)
- Edit your changes
- Stage your files with `git add ___`
- Create another commit using `git commit -m ___`
- Push your commit to the remote with `git push origin ____`

## Guide Recap

Let's take a moment to review what you learned in this guide.

- What is version control?
- What is Git? And what is Github?
- Local Repo vs. Remote Repo
- What is a Git Commit?
- What is Git Branching?
  - Local Branch vs. Remote Branch
- Using the Github website portal
- Using your operating system's Command Line Interface (CLI): Terminal / Command Prompt
- Using the Git CLI
- Creating and updating a Pull Request with Git

Again, great work! Version Control systems like Git are frequently and widely used in the coding world. Even if you don't pursue a career in software development, it's a skillset that is very much appreciated by companies, research groups or even for small projects!

Thanks for taking the time to go through this guide and please leave me any feedback if you have any. I would really appreciate it! Also, if you have a friend that wants to learn Git and Github, feel free to show them this repository and guide!
